# Introduction #

**Visual Preview** is another anticipated feature of nsync 2.0. With **Visual Preview**, you can always be assured that files and folders will be transfered and synchronized the way you want them to be.

You can have a visual comparison between these two folders and see what actions will be taken by nsync. Folders are highlighted in blue, while files are highlighted in white. And finally, you can decide which folder to view by selecting the different option in the drop-down box. Simple and intuitive.

# How **Visual Preview** works #

2. A window will appear with the results of the post synchronization state of the folders. The default view option is both folders (see picture in Introduction). You can also choose to display only either folder.
