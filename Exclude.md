# Introduction #

**Exclude** is included in version 2.0 of nsync release. This feature allows you to drag-and-drop any files or folders that you wish to omit for the synchronization. If you wish to remove the filter added, just click on it and it will be gone! It's that simple!

You can also choose to manually select the list of different file types from the drop-down box. nsync will scan the different file types located in both folders and display them in the box.

# How Exclude works #

1. Drag-and-drop any files or folders into the drop zone. The list will indicate that the item you dropped has been successfully added to the list.

3. Once you are done, just click the right arrow icon and you are ready to start synchronizing folders! Alternatively, you may choose to discard all of the items in the list by clicking on the trashbin icon.
