# Details #

**For First Time**

-- Start off by downloading Tortoise SVN. I believe the current version is 1.6.7.

-- Create an empty folder on desktop.

-- Rightclick on folder and click on SVN Checkout

-- You will see a prompt screen and under **repository URL** you will type in _https://nsync.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/_ (Note : this link can be found under the source tab.)

-- There will be another prompt which request for your username and password. The username would be your google username and the password is auto-generated. Go to the source tab and you will see _When prompted, enter your generated googlecode.com password_ . The link will take you to a page where a password is auto-generated. Copy and paste that in.

-- Click on 'ok' and the program will download the current Revision into that folder.

**Subsequent Use**

-- Each time you edit something in that folder, you will see an red exclamation mark, when you commit the folder, you will see a green tick.

-- To update or commit your folder, simply right-click and choose the respective options.
