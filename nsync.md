# Introduction #

nsync is a free, open source file synchronization software for Windows running on the Microsoft .NET platform.

nsync allows the synchronization of your data between desktop PCs, laptops, USB drives and more. We pride our software in being built ‘by users, for users’. Hence, we’ve come out with an elegant and easy-to-use interface, which does synchronization reliably and intelligently.

# Why use nsync? #

  * Do synchronization between folders in just 3 simple steps.
  * Drag and Drop your folders. It's cool and intuitive.
  * It's intelligent!

# Our Design Principles #

  * **Be minimalistic.** The less there is on the interface, the better. Put what’s really needed up there.
  * **Don’t prompt, make intelligent guesses.** Notify the users that we’ve made a guess and allow them to make their own decisions. Do this gently and unassumingly.
  * **Make it pretty.** Packaging is important; make it eye-catching but not overly or offensively so.
  * **Understandable.** No manual or instructions should be needed.
  * **Fast.** Synchronization has to be fast.
  * **Stick to the above principles!** We are engineers, designers and programmers, but above all, we’re users too. Put the user first.
